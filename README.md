## Election-Audit Summary
- This script can be modified and used for any election. One improvement that could be made, is adding an editable text file to allow anyone (regardless of programmer experience level) to edit the variables that are being input into the script. A second improvement that could be made, is to allow multiple csv files to be loaded to allow auditing of election data from multiple sources (districts, states, etc.).
